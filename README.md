Asteroids

Just working on learning the Phaser game engine.

## Getting Started

The game code is contained mostly within index.html in a massive **script** tag.  The game is run by opening index.html in a browser.

### Prerequisites

You will need a browser that supports HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone
# Go into the repository
cd asteroids
# Open index.html in a browser
```

### Installing

No installation required.

## Built With

* Phaser - HTML5 Game Framework
* jQuery - JavaScript Library
* AWS - to save and retrieve high scores

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details

I would point out that my AWS URL is not guaranteed to continue working, and I may add authentication or the requirement of a key to access the high scores.  I am not responsible for any loss of data or service.
